# MEDACK (Still in Progress)

The idea on creating this mobile application came when i reliaze how hard it is for me to help my 
grandparents who still struggling reading their meds. 
The fact that i was't there to help them make me sad. 
They sometime give me a call just to ask about thier meds, it getting difficult for me to help when i cant read properlly the package. 
So i was thinking what is me or my aunts can just snap it when they get the precribe from Doctor or my grand parents can just snap 
the package to get the information they needs.

## Planned Core function

* Integrating Gemini AI to extract meds information from package or prescribtion given by pharmacies.
* Real time update on care giver @ family member side of application.
* Mini chatbot for  Meds QnA
